 Chinook Data Analysis Project

## Overview
The Chinook data analysis project aims to gain insights from the Chinook database, which contains information about a music store's media, tracks, playlists, invoices, and customers. The project involves exploring the data, performing various analyses, and generating reports to help the store make informed business decisions.

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the data to understand its structure, relationships, and potential insights.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean and preprocess the data as needed, handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data using visualizations and statistical methods.
4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Formulate and test hypotheses related to the statistics questions .
5. **Reporting and Recommendations**: Generate reports and visualizations to communicate the findings and provide actionable recommendations to the business stakeholders.
